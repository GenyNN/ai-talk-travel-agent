# Travel Agent Console Client Usage Guide

## Overview
The updated console client now provides three modes of interaction with the advanced travel agent:

1. **Regular Chat** - Direct AI conversation
2. **Interactive Travel Agent** - Step-by-step travel planning
3. **Quick Travel Agent** - One-shot travel planning

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Server
First, make sure the FastAPI server is running:
```bash
python main.py
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:8001`

### 2. Start the Console Client
In a new terminal, run:
```bash
python console_client.py
```

### 3. Choose Your Mode

```
üí¨ You: travel
```

This mode will:
- Guide you through all 6 goals step by step
- Ask about trip type, destination, group size, dates, and departure city
- Handle errors gracefully with retry logic
- Generate a comprehensive summary at the end
- Allow you to exit anytime with 'quit', 'exit', or 'stop'

```
üí¨ You: quick
```

This mode will:
